## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Integration
- Uses existing `create_db_connection()` function
- Leverages `execute_query_for_dashboard()` pattern
- Implements proper Manila timezone handling (`AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Manila'`)
- Filters for valid sales transactions only

### AI Integration
- Uses existing `get_claude_client()` function
- Implements AI-powered weekly business reviews
- Generates automated insights and recommendations

### Caching Strategy
- Implements `@st.cache_data` with appropriate TTL values:
  - High-frequency data: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
  - Medium-frequency data: 1800-3600 seconds (30-60 minutes)
  - Low-frequency data: 7200 seconds (2 hours)

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for empty query results
- Appropriate `st.info()` messages for no data scenarios
- Try/except blocks around external API calls
- Loading spinners for all data operations

## 📊 Analytics Features

### 1. Hidden Demand Detection
- Identifies products with sales history but current stockouts
- Calculates hidden demand scores based on:
  - Average daily demand × 20
  - Recency bonus (days since last sale)
  - Stock level penalty
- Color-coded urgency levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

### 2. Stockout Predictions
- Calculates days until stockout based on current inventory and demand velocity
- Classifies urgency levels:
  - **CRITICAL**: ≤ 3 days
  - **HIGH**: ≤ 7 days
  - **MEDIUM**: ≤ 14 days
  - **LOW**: > 14 days

### 3. Demand Trend Analysis
- Analyzes weekly sales patterns over 12 weeks
- Determines trend direction (UP/DOWN/STABLE)
- Calculates confidence levels based on data consistency
- Uses simple linear regression for trend calculation

### 4. Seasonal Product Identification
- Analyzes 24 months of monthly sales data
- Calculates coefficient of variation for seasonality detection
- Identifies peak months and seasonal strength
- Provides season descriptions (Holiday, Summer, etc.)

### 5. Product Lifecycle Analysis
- Categorizes products into lifecycle stages:
  - **Introduction**: ≤ 3 months, high growth
  - **Growth**: ≤ 6 months, moderate growth
  - **Maturity**: > 6 months, stable performance
  - **Decline**: Declining recent performance
- Calculates performance scores (Excellent/Good/Stable/Declining)

### 6. Customer Intelligence
- **Shopping Patterns**: Heatmap visualization by day/hour
- **Basket Analysis**: Frequently co-purchased product pairs
- **RFM Segmentation**: Customer segmentation based on:
  - Recency (days since last purchase)
  - Frequency (number of transactions)
  - Monetary (total spending)

### 7. Market Intelligence
- **Price Elasticity**: Analyzes sales volume at different price points
- **Market Opportunities**: Category-level opportunity scoring
- Elasticity categories: Highly Elastic/Elastic/Moderate/Inelastic

### 8. Smart Alerts
- **Stockout Alerts**: Critical and warning levels
- **Demand Spike Alerts**: High-demand product detection
- Real-time monitoring with configurable thresholds

### 9. Automated Insights
- **Weekly Business Review**: AI-generated insights comparing current vs previous week
- **Trending Products**: Identifies products with increasing transaction frequency
- Uses Claude API for natural language insights

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Status Dashboard
- 6-column metrics display:
  - Learning Examples
  - Forecast Accuracy
  - Active Alerts
  - Trends Detected
  - Opportunities
  - Performance Score

### Color Coding
- **Urgency Levels**:
  - 🔴 Critical: #ff0000
  - 🟠 High: #ff8800
  - 🟡 Medium: #ffff00
  - 🟢 Low: #00ff00

- **Trend Directions**:
  - 🟢 UP: #00ff00
  - 🔴 DOWN: #ff4444
  - 🟡 STABLE: #ffaa00

### Interactive Features
- Refresh buttons for all analytics sections
- Loading spinners for data operations
- Expandable sections and detailed views
- Download capabilities for data exports

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Running the Application
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### Accessing Advanced Data Analytics
1. Launch the application
2. Select "🔬 Advanced Data" from the sidebar navigation
3. Explore the 5 sub-tabs for different analytics categories
4. Use refresh buttons to update data
5. Configure alert settings in the Smart Alerts tab

### Configuration
- Alert thresholds can be adjusted in the Smart Alerts tab
- Cache TTL values can be modified in the engine classes
- Database queries can be customized for specific business needs

## 🔍 Testing

### Verification Script
Run the verification script to ensure implementation is working:
```bash
python verify_implementation.py
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Queries use appropriate indexes and filtering
- Result sets are limited to prevent oversized responses
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection

### Caching Strategy
- Different TTL values based on data volatility
- Cache invalidation on refresh button clicks
- Memory-efficient caching for large datasets

### UI Performance
- Lazy loading of analytics sections
- Progressive disclosure of detailed data
- Efficient dataframe operations

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
