# Advanced Analytics Page Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully added an "Advanced Analytics" page to the existing Streamlit app with comprehensive analytics engines using the existing database schema. The implementation follows all the specified requirements and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase as a dedicated page in the sidebar navigation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. 🔍 Demand Analytics Engine
- **Advanced Hidden Demand Detection**: Statistically robust system using time-series analysis, correlation, and multi-factor confidence scoring
- **Stockout Prediction**: Calculates days until stockout using daily velocity analysis with risk categorization (CRITICAL, WARNING, SAFE)

### 2. 📊 Predictive Forecasting Engine
- **Demand Trend Forecasting**: Uses REGR_SLOPE for weekly sales analysis with trend direction and confidence scoring
- **Seasonal Product Identification**: Monthly sales coefficient of variation analysis to detect seasonal patterns
- **Product Lifecycle Analysis**: Categorizes products into Introduction/Growth, Maturity, Decline, or Stable stages

### 3. 👥 Customer Intelligence Engine
- **Shopping Pattern Analysis**: Transaction counts by hour and day of week with Manila timezone
- **Basket Analysis**: Co-purchased product pairs analysis
- **Customer Segmentation**: RFM analysis using customer_ref_id with segmentation into VIP, Loyal, At Risk, Lost, and Regular categories

### 4. 🚨 Smart Alert Manager
- **Active Alerts**: Queries inventory for stockouts and low stock warnings
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Real-time alert system for critical inventory issues

### 5. 🤖 Automated Insight Engine
- **Weekly Business Review**: AI-powered analysis using Claude API
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Performance metrics, trends, and actionable recommendations

## Advanced Statistical System for Hidden Demand Detection

### Core Features
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Daily sales patterns with gap detection and trend correlation
- **Statistical Confidence Scoring**: Multi-factor algorithm (0-100% confidence scale)
- **Demand Volatility Assessment**: Separates normal variation from disruptions
- **Rolling Averages**: 14-day moving averages to smooth demand patterns
- **Regression Analysis**: Linear trend detection using REGR_SLOPE and CORR
- **Multi-Factor Recommendation System**: URGENT_RESTOCK, HIGH_CONFIDENCE, MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE, INVESTIGATE
- **Actionable Insights**: Specific business recommendations for each product

### Statistical Methodology
```sql
-- Core demand metrics
AVG(daily_qty) as avg_daily_demand,
STDDEV(daily_qty) as demand_volatility,
COUNT(*) as sales_days,

-- Time gap analysis
AVG(CASE WHEN gap_days IS NOT NULL THEN gap_days ELSE 1 END) as avg_gap_days,
MAX(gap_days) as max_gap_days,
CURRENT_DATE - MAX(sale_date) as days_since_last_sale,

-- Trend detection (simplified linear regression)
REGR_SLOPE(daily_qty, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM sale_date)) as trend_slope,
CORR(daily_qty, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM sale_date)) as trend_correlation,

-- Recent vs historical comparison
AVG(CASE WHEN sale_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days' 
    THEN daily_qty ELSE NULL END) as recent_30d_avg,
AVG(CASE WHEN sale_date < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days' 
    THEN daily_qty ELSE NULL END) as historical_avg
```

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm
```sql
-- Multi-factor confidence score (0-1 scale)
LEAST(1.0, GREATEST(0.0,
    (CASE WHEN historical_avg > 1.0 THEN 0.3 ELSE historical_avg * 0.3 END) +
    (stockout_signal * 0.25) +
    (disruption_score * 0.25) +
    (CASE WHEN trend_correlation > 0.1 THEN 0.1 ELSE 0 END) +
    (CASE WHEN demand_volatility < avg_daily_demand THEN 0.1 ELSE 0 END)
)) as confidence_score
```
