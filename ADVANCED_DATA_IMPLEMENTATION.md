# Advanced Analytics Page Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully added an "Advanced Analytics" page to the existing Streamlit app with comprehensive analytics engines using the existing database schema. The implementation follows all the specified requirements and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase as a dedicated page in the sidebar navigation.

- **Stockout Prediction**: Calculates days until stockout using daily velocity analysis with risk categorization (CRITICAL, WARNING, SAFE)

### 2. üìä Predictive Forecasting Engine
- **Demand Trend Forecasting**: Uses REGR_SLOPE for weekly sales analysis with trend direction and confidence scoring
- **Seasonal Product Identification**: Monthly sales coefficient of variation analysis to detect seasonal patterns
- **Product Lifecycle Analysis**: Categorizes products into Introduction/Growth, Maturity, Decline, or Stable stages

### 3. üë• Customer Intelligence Engine
